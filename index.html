                            Java is a <b>high-level, class-based, object-oriented</b> programming 
                            language  and computing platform first released by <u>Sun Microsystems</u> in <b>1995</b>.
                        <li>History of Java:-</li>
                        <p>Java, originally named<b> Oak</b>, was developed as a part of the <u>Green Project</u>
                            at <u>Sun Microsystems</u>. It was started in <b>December '90</b> by Patrick Naughton,
                            Mike Sheridan and James Gosling, their team leader <b>James Gosling</b>, 
                           Whatever programming language existed before 1995 was platform dependent.
                           The Main Purpose of Creating the Oak Programming Language <u>platform independence</u> <b>(WORA) Write 
                           Once Run Anywhere</b> . So James Gosling and his team 
                            members created this programming language called Oak and cup, plate with the 
                            vapor in the logo because there was a coffee plant called Oak outside 
                            his office, but in <u>1994</u> the name of <u>Oak was changed to Java</u>. Because 
                            the company named Oak was already registered. Java was later bought by 
                            Oracle.

                            Every system has its own JVM which gets installed automatically when 
                            the jdk software is installed. Java is a platform independent language
                            while the JVM is plateform dependent.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
                            JVM acts as a run-time engine to run Java applications JVM is the 
                            one that actually calls the JVM is the one that actually calls the 
                            main method presrnt in a Java code.<br>
                            <span class="bg-primary"><b>JVM is a part of JRE(Java Runtime Envorment)</b></span><br>
                            Java applications are called WORA. This means a programmer can develop
                            Java code on one system and can expect it to run on any other Java 
                            enabled system without any adjustment. This is all possible because of
                            JVM.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
                            When we compile a .java file, .class files(contains byte-code) with the
                            same class names present in .java file are generated by je Java compiler.
                            this .class file goes into various steps when we run iy. these steps
                            together describe the whole JVM.
